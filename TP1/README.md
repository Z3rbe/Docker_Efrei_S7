## 1.1
	Easy to Change: You can change variables without rebuilding the image.
	More Secure: Sensitive info (like passwords) stays safe.
	Cleaner: The Dockerfile stays simple.
	Flexible: You can use different settings for different environments.
## 1.2
	Keeps Data Safe: Without it, your data is lost if the container stops.
	Easier Backup: You can back up and restore your data easily.
	Better Performance: Volumes give faster access to data.
	Easy Updates: You can update the container without losing data.
## 1.4
	Smaller image: It keeps only the necessary files in the final image (no build tools or extra files).
	Separation: It separates the build process from the runtime environment.
	Faster builds: Docker caches steps, so rebuilding is quicker if nothing changes.
## 1.5
	Load Balancing: It spreads traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading one server.
	Security: It hides your backend servers from the outside world, protecting them from attacks.
	SSL Termination: It handles secure connections (HTTPS), so your servers donâ€™t have to.
	Authentication: It can manage logins and access control before letting users reach your services.
	Caching: It stores frequently used data to make requests faster.
	Easier Setup: It lets you manage multiple services under one domain.
## 1.6
	Easier Management: It lets you manage multiple containers at once with a single command.
	Simple Setup: You define all your services (containers, networks, volumes) in a simple YAML file.
	Environment Consistency: It helps you run the same setup across different environments (local, staging, production).
	Quick Deployment: It speeds up the process of starting and stopping your entire app with just one command.
	Automates Linking: It automatically connects containers and handles their dependencies.
## 1.7
	docker compose up --build -d
	docker down
	docker ps
## 1.10
	Share Easily: You can share images with others.
	Central Storage: Keeps all your images in one place.
	Version Control: Store different versions and go back to older ones if needed.
	Access Anywhere: Pull images from any machine.
	Automation: Works with tools to automate building and deploying images.
	Collaboration: Multiple people can use the same images.
	Scalable: Easy to manage lots of images in the cloud.
